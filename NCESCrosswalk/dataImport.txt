In order to import the datasets into R, a package to read excel files needs to be used.

First run

install.packages('readxl')

Then following installation run

library(readxl)

This will install the readxl package to the current environment. Then I used the "read_xlsx" file to read the data sets. 

The following data sets were imported and named as follows

bls - downloadable xlsx file from BLS https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm

crosswalk - the CIP SOC 2020 Crosswalk https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/post3.aspx?y=56 using only the CIP-SOC sheet

CIPCrosswalk - csv downloaded that converts 2010 to 2020 CIPS https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/crosswalk.aspx?y=56
