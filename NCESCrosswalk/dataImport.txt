In order to import the datasets into R, a package to read excel files needs to be used.

First run

install.packages('readxl')

Then following installation run

library(readxl)

Set the working directory to where the file is

setwd("~/StrideFundingProject")

This will install the readxl package to the current environment. Then I used the "read_xlsx" file to read the data sets. 

The following data sets were imported and named as follows



bls = read_xlsx(file.choose()) 

- downloadable xlsx file from BLS https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.html
Named "national_M2020_dl.xlsx"

crosswalk = read_xlsx(file.choose(),"CIP-SOC")

 - the CIP SOC 2020 Crosswalk https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/post3.aspx?y=56 using only the CIP-SOC sheet
Named "CIP2020_SOC2018_Crosswalk.xlsx"

CIPCrosswalk = read.csv(file.choose())

- csv downloaded that converts 2010 to 2020 CIPS https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/crosswalk.aspx?y=56
Named "Crosswalk.csv"
