Stride Funding / Lafayette College Fall 2021 Independent Study

Problem Statement
Stride Funding provides students with an alternative to private student loans. Stride Income Sharing
Agreements (ISAs) are structured as payments that are tied to future income once the student enters
the workforce and is earning a living wage. As a result, Stride relies on granular historical salary data
and model-driven estimates to be able to price each ISA as precisely as possible in the context of the
students’ school and program of study. Matching each educational institution and program of study
(major) to potential and historical earnings information is a challenging undertaking for a few reasons:
	-While the Department of Education via its College Scorecard initiative provides some
	information on earnings by field of study (“CIP” code), the availability of that information is
	limited to a subset of schools and lacks any historical depth beyond 1st and 2nd year after
	graduation
	-The field of study classification from DoE’s College Scorecard cannot be directly linked to
	economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Census Bureau, and other sources of
	earnings and employment statistics data in any direct way with respect to how these sources
	classify occupations

Desired Outcome
Given the above context, Stride Funding is looking for a multi-component solution that addresses 3
fundamental challenges:
	1. Identifying and documenting a set of one of more robust methodologies that can provide
	reliable and tractable connections between DoE field of study classifications (CIP codes) and
	BLS/Census/Department of Labor classifications of occupations
	2. Develop a programmatic proof-of-concept prototype that productionizes the methodologies
	identified and (1) above; and, finally,
	3. Provide an assessment of the benefit of data coverage in breadth (field of study) and time
	(historical) that the linkage between DoE and BLS classifications will provide.
